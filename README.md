This project is part of a greater personal project in which I would like to fully automate an indoor gardening system. Currently, it has been created for and is being work on within my CS 361 class where I have been learning to incorporate git into my workflow, as well as divide my project into microservices. A big focus on this project is beginning to use the Agile project management model to efficiently complete my work.
